Changelog:
pySioGame - 3.70.xxx:
    - Serbian language added by Miroslav Nikolic (Мирослав Николић)
    - minor changes to menu to enable scrolling on drag
pySioGame - 3.70.104:
    - changed the way the objects can be dragged around in most games where movement constrained to the grid was not beneficial, now items can be dragged freely around the play area and only snap to grid on button release - this will contribute to decreasing of frustration especially for new users.
    - the previous change forced another feature - the images and objects that support the new style of movement and can be dragged over other items had to be changed to images with transparent backgrounds that are taking up more space - in effect causing an increase of the size of the package.
    - Spanish translation updated by Mario Izquierdo
    - a number of cosmetic changes to the colours of objects in order to unify the colour scheme of the games
pySioGame - 3.61.120:
    - updated Greek translation by Alexandros Moskofidis

    - minor fixes to other translation files
pySioGame - 3.60.814:
    - added German translation by Oliver van der Bürie
    - fixed an issue where the word games would break if word contained upper case letter
    - changed the game so that objects can jump over other objects rather than being stuck, when direct path was not free (except for the games where the previous behaviour was expected or needed), previously whilst that behaviour would be considered a feature, it would cause unnecessary frustration more often then needed.

    - just some minor clean ups, to fix a number of issues when packaging
pySioGame - 3.50.311:
    - added French translation by Gino Ingras

pySioGame - 3.50.210:
    - quick bug fix of the new multiplication game crash on level completion

           The choice of modes available: default full colour, black on white background, white on black and yellow on black.
           Some games that rely on colour remain unchanged or have been changed to better fit the black background - and care has been taken to create a contrast in lightness of colour.
pySioGame - 2.40.105-dev:
    - added (partial) support for right-to-left languages
    - added Hebrew translation by Ori Hoch

pySioGame - 1.31.127-dev:
    - Russian language updated by Алексей Логинов
    - language files moved around again - most of the files are still stored in the i18n folder, but compiled .mo files are now stored under locale in appriopriate folders
        - if necessary for packaging copy each of those files to the corresponding folder in usr/share/locale and change the new location link in lang.py
    - game resources moved to res directory
    - English language related activities moved to a separate category in non English speaking locales
    - additional espeak process is being started to enable the game to read text in English when playing with one of above mentioned activities
    - added option to auto-login you on next visit - the login screen will appear for a fraction of a second and then tha main window will open
    - to go back to the initial screen or admin settings you have to press the log out "link" in top right corner.
    - added exit button on the initial screen
    - multiple bugs fixes - thanks to Алексей Логинов for finding and reporting them.

    - added an initial screen used for login and administrative settings
    - some settings have been moved to administrator's settings
    - enabling sound and eSpeak in game is now done by clicking on the icons in left top corner of the game area
      when connecting with espeak is not possible the option to enable it is hidden, and the wording of the console message is changed - partly solved bug #721899
    - all user data is now saved in a 'pysiogame.db' database stored in $XDG_DATA_HOME/pysiogame or $HOME/.local/share/pysiogame - solves bug #721830
    - country flags are no longer used for language selection - solves bug #721829
    - added ability to create accounts, a default account Guest is automatically created for you
    - on first start the game tries to detect your local language and uses it if translation or close translation is available,
      ie. if your detected language is pt_BR, but only pt_PT translation is available, the later will be used for both Portugal and Brazil
      as the default language for the login screen and newly created accounts. This can be changed in language settings on login screen.
      English is still used as default if language is not found.
    - Translations are now a mixture of .po files and some custom translations (where more control over the translation was required) - solves wishlist item #721852
    - solved a critical bug in "Color Matching" game (the game crashed when the width was larger than 5 squares and the colour label was dragged onto the empty square in the top line)
    - minor fixes to some of the games
    - where completing a level is possible the completed level numbers are highlighted
    - added possibility to receive points (where applicable) for completing games
    - flashcard images are now stored as a separate files rather than sprite - takes up more space but is easier to add new images.
    - added Catalan Language - thanks to Guillem Jover.
    - 2 new activities
pySioGame - 1.30.7xx - beta:
    - level data and game preferences including currently selected language are now stored in $XDG_DATA_HOME/pysiogame or $HOME/.local/share/pysiogame depending on configuration.
    - new games added including activities to teach kids reading clock hands, one more multiplication table activity and a little tool useful in learning various types of shapes.
    - some tweaks done to the way titles are being displayed
    - scrolling categories/games in menu now moves them one at a time rather than skipping to the very bottom + added support for mouse wheel for scrolling.
    - quitting game through the bottom-right button requires two clicks (not necessarily double click), Esc and in windowed version "X" button gets you out of the game without confirmation.
    - paint game - brush size now being changed by slider rather than +/- buttons
    - window can now be re-sized (but exactly as with toggling full-screen on and off - changing window size will also reload the current activity, so don't do it in the middle of working on something)
    - handwriting font redrawn: advantages: one font for all languages, no more unknown authors and licences for fonts, more letters available including accents, tildes and what not, disadvantages: it's not as visually pleasing as the previous ones and there's no arrow guides the previous fonts had.
    - and many other changes to the way the game looks and works.
    - PS. changed the version numbering system and since this large leap in numbers, and yes still beta and the game is very likely to stay in beta through its entire life

pySioGame - 0.4.1 - beta:
    - added Spanish translation - thanks to Miriam Ruiz
    - removed a bug in calculating window size

pySioGame - 0.4.0 - beta:
    - added partially translated Russian Version - thanks to Anton Kayukov (Антон Каюков) - sorry I forgot do do it earlier
    - added new activities
    - 3 math games split into separate games so different operations are now under separate launching button
    - made cosmetic changes to some of the existing activities.
    - optimized images further
    - now it is possible to change child's name in settings screen (just start typing and press enter when finished)

pySioGame - 0.3.1.2 - beta:
    - corrected some area/volume formulas and changed shape/solid images - added labels
    - paint - flat brush behaviour changed slightly.

pySioGame - 0.3.1 - beta:
    - changed the Paint activity:
        - added short history (undo/redo)
        - added new straight line tool
        - changed the painting functions slightly
    - changed 'circumference' to 'perimeter' in shape flashcards

pySioGame - 0.3.0 - beta:
    - levels are now being saved to file, so when you switch activities or close the game - next time you come back levels will be set just as they were when you left (auto-save on activity change and on program close).
    - object surfaces are only repainted when something changed on them (ie. colour, text or image) - helped to speed up the game in some cases - mainly paint and letter tracing activities. But all activities should work faster now. (unfortunately they are still all blitted to the screen when screen needs to be updated - no plans to change it)
    - added new colour creation activities
    - Hit the Mole game still not perfect but now the game finishes earlier if maximum number of allowed escapes is exceeded.
    - "read game instructions at the start of games" now disabled - it turned out to be a bit annoying - now you can listen to this text if you click on the instruction box.

pySioGame - 0.2.3 - pre-alpha:
    - added Touch Typing program - only available in English US and UK, Polish and Russian language versions (sorry to other language speakers - I do not know how to guide someone to use dead keys, etc. in multiple languages)
        - this will remain unfinished - I have started it and realized that it is more like an idea for an entire standalone application rather than a small add-on to this game - but still did not want to throw away the work I have done on it so far
        - there are programs like this already out there - ie. KTouch, Klavaro, etc.
    - converted some of the largest .png files to .jpg format - saved over 2MB
    - completed* the letter flashcards - added new words and images (in some languages where I could not find a reasonable word the letter was left uncompleted) - done as much as possible without any knowledge of some of the languages - take it with pinch of salt and let me know about any errors.
    - The multiplication/division games now additionally accept numbers typed on a keyboard as a faster way of response (type answer and press enter to confirm)
    - added another Connect numbers game - but this time numbers are stacked vertically - makes more use of space if you have a wide-screen monitor.
    - corrected pronunciation of Polish letters in the alphabet/letter games (ł,ń,ó,ś,w,z,ź,ż)

pySioGame - 0.2.2 - pre-alpha:
    - added multi-row functionality to the multi-sprite object, which in turn:
    - fixed the problem with game crashing on letter flashcard game

pySioGame - 0.2.1 - pre-alpha:
	- corrected few errors
	- added new colour matching game - colours stacked vertically so there is more space for colour names

        - currently works with English, Russian and Greek - other languages will be completed soon
    - fixed some bugs
    - corrected the error with triangles - swapped the descriptions over Obtuse Triangle and Acute Triangle - again thanks to Στέλιος for pointing it out

pySioGame - 0.0.2.1 - pre-alpha:
    Some minor changes to make the game more touch-screen friendly:
        - replaced the right button click function to skip the levels with additional 2 graphical buttons (available when needed).
        - added little graphical arrow key pad in games that require the arrow keys - not tested on touch screens - are the buttons large enough for little fingers?
        - in the owl memory game - the "in-game" arrows are now clickable/tapable
    Other changes:
        - sheep maze - sheep movement now slightly changed - now the object (the sheep) behaves nearly the same as other movable objects in the game
            - holding the arrow key will make it move till it hits the wall or end of board
        - enabled the game to be translated to Finnish.

pySioGame - 0.0.2 - (0.0.2.0) - pre-alpha:
    End User Point of View:
    	- added preferences panel:
    		- used to select language - so far English, American English and Polish are somewhat complete
    		- other languages can be enabled - but are untranslated - this is for translators to test their work
    		- now you can turn off the eSpeak - if you want to - as well as enable instructions for the games - uncompleted yet
    		- you can now select to start the game full screen next time - enable Fullscreen
    		- your selected settings will automatically be saved in languages/lang_config.txt - make sure it can be written to
    	- added 2 (+1) new games:
    		1. 3D shapes - flashcards
    		2. Another alphabet completion game
    			- but this one includes special characters of selected language
    			- no big difference in English apart from it being now on 2 lines
    		3. Letter writing game with Russian Letters - uncompleted / needs a better font / no arrows yet
    	- changed few games:
    		- made them capable of displaying non standard characters, ie. accents, Cyrllica, etc.
    		- the letter sorting games now use full alphabet of a selected language
    		- added little word lists to each of the languages that I plan to support
    			- these will be used by word builder/word maze games
    		- added few colors to the colour game, ie. brown (silly me - I forgot about brown :)
    		- first level in colour game is now indented as a learning tool rather than testing knowledge of colours
    		- shopping list now has limited number of fruits/veg in each row to 7, and the basket rectangle is closer to the items
    		- Hit the Mole game now moved to games - this game is in fact still unfinished - no hammer yet - and the graphic could be hanged
    		- some games had it's number of games per level and number of levels changed
    		- word list has changed completely - the words in it are kind of more commonly used words in English
    	- renamed first category to hold game information, copyright info and settings, and some related stuff in the future
    	- changed few category icons

    Technical changes:
    	- changed coding of all source files to utf-8
    	- enabled the objects to render/speak and deal with utf-8 characters
    		- and all this to still keep it py2.7.2 and py3+ compatible (let me know if it is not)
    	- fixed scaling problem in older pygame versions ( < 1.8 - hopefully fixed - untested)
    	- cleaned up a little bit, removed (emptied) some disused/replaced game files that has been left in game_boards folder
    		- the empty files are still there as placeholders for new stuff in the future did not want to rename files to fill the gap, and the way the games are added to __all__ does not allow for number skipping.
    	- removed old icons and disused images, renamed some images so related stuff stays together.
    	- changed font from default None to FreeSansBold (which BTW was default), but specifying the font name dealt with a problem of cropping accents at the top.
    	- added loadable/savable settings - as above the languages/lang_config.txt needs to be writable.
    	- now most of the changes in the Config object/class will be overridden by data loaded from file
    		- only changes to screen auto-detect and screen size related stuff works, rest of settings in file.

    I guess that's a long story short, I hope I haven't missed anything important. Please let me know if any of the new changes or anything else breaks the game.
